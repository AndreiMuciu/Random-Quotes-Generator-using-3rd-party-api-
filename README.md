This is a project made to show the knowledge I have in working with 3rd party APIs. For the realization of the project we used data from the website: https://api-ninjas.com/. I ran the code from the frontend using the live-server command from node, so I would ask you to run it in the same way so that there are no problems.

I created the user stories myself, these are the ones written in the final version:
1. I want the user to be able to select a category of quotes.
2. I want that when I press a button, the quote will be displayed on the screen together with its author at random from the possibly selected category.
3. if I don't select any category, I want a random quote from any category to appear.
